### Welcome 👽
I'm Cameron - a software engineer in Brisbane, Australia.

### 🧑🏽‍💻 Working on:
* Building more features for [Tiny API](https://tiny-api.dev) - A web tool for front end devs who quickly need a temporary API to use for development.
* Building a markdown blog for my [website](https://harderhutton.dev), 2021 will be the year that I start sharing things I learn!
* Getting more experience creating Continuous Deployment pipelines, deploying directly to VPSs instead of managed containers.
* Conceptualising Diff Doc - a Wide-Column Database written in [Golang](https://golang.org/) for storing large amounts of very large and highly redundant JSON documents
