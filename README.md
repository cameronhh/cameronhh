### I'm Cameron - a software engineer in Brisbane, Australia

### At the moment, I'm working on:
* Building more features for [Tiny API](https://tiny-api.dev) - A web tool for front end devs who quickly need a temporary API to use for development
* Deploying a demo-version of Checkomo - An open-source QR code check-in management application that a friend and I created
* Getting more experience creating Continuous Deployment pipelines, deploying directly to VPSs instead of managed containers
* Conceptualising Diff Doc - a Wide-Column Database written in (I'm not sure yet) for storing large amounts of very large and highly redundant JSON documents

### Say Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm always keen to meet other people in tech and talk about tech-y things! Send me an email at [cameron@harderhutton.dev](mailto:cameron@harderhutton.dev) or drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-harder-hutton/).
