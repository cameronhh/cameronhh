### I'm Cameron - a software engineer in Brisbane, Australia
Take a look at my public projects! If you're a front-end dev, you might find [Tiny API](https://tiny-api.dev) useful!

### At the moment, I'm working on:
* Taking a rest to prepare for my new job, starting in mid-March
* Writing more things in Go

### Backburner ðŸ¤”
* Building more features for [Tiny API](https://tiny-api.dev) - A tongue-in-cheek web tool for anyone who quickly needs a temporary API to use for development
* Diff Doc - a Wide-Column Database written in (I'm not sure yet) for storing large amounts of very large and highly redundant JSON documents

### Say Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm always keen to meet other people in tech and talk about tech-y things! Send me an email at [cameron@harderhutton.dev](mailto:cameron@harderhutton.dev) or drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-harder-hutton/).
